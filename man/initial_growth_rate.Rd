\title{Initial exponential growth rate}
\usage{
initial_growth_rate(incidence, time = NULL, n = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{Numeric vector of incidence values.
Values must be strictly positive over the estimation window.}

\item{time}{Optional numeric vector of time points. Must have the
same length as \code{incidence}. If \code{NULL}, a regular time
sequence is assumed.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of initial time points used for estimation.
Must be at least 2. Default is 7.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the estimated exponential growth rate.
}
\description{
Estimates the early exponential growth rate by fitting a log-linear model
to the initial segment of an incidence curve.
}
\details{
During the early phase of an epidemic, incidence is often approximated by:
\deqn{
\lambda(t) \approx C e^{r t},
}
where \eqn{r} is the exponential growth rate.

Taking logarithms:
\deqn{
\log \lambda(t) = \log C + r t,
}
so that \eqn{r} can be estimated as the slope of a linear regression
of \eqn{\log(\lambda(t))} on \eqn{t}.

The growth rate is estimated using the first \code{n} time points,
which are assumed to belong to the exponential growth phase.

If \code{time} is not provided, it is assumed to be a regular
sequence \code{1:length(incidence)}.
