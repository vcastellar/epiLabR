\title{Peak prevalence}
\usage{
peak_prevalence(prevalence, time = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{prevalence}{Numeric vector representing prevalence over time.}

\item{time}{Optional numeric vector of time points. Must have the
same length as \code{prevalence}. If \code{NULL}, a regular time
sequence is assumed.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{peak}{Maximum prevalence value.}
\item{time}{Time at which the peak occurs.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the maximum value of a prevalence curve and
the time at which it occurs.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{I(t)} denote prevalence over time.
The peak prevalence is defined as:
\deqn{
I_{\max} = \max_t I(t).
}

The function returns both the maximum value and the
corresponding time point.

If \code{time} is not provided, it is assumed to be a regular
sequence \code{1:length(prevalence)}.
}
\examples{
I <- c(1, 5, 8, 4, 2)
peak_prevalence(I)
