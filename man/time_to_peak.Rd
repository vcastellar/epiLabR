\title{Time to peak incidence}
\usage{
time_to_peak(incidence, time = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{Numeric vector giving the incidence curve.}

\item{time}{Optional numeric vector of time points. Must have the
same length as \code{incidence}. If \code{NULL}, a regular time
sequence is assumed.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the time at which incidence
reaches its maximum.
}
\description{
Computes the time at which the incidence curve reaches its maximum.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{\lambda(t)} denote the incidence over time.
The time to peak is defined as:
\deqn{
t_{\max} = \arg\max_t \lambda(t).
}

If multiple time points attain the maximum value,
the first occurrence is returned.

If \code{time} is not provided, it is assumed to be a regular
sequence \code{1:length(incidence)}.
}
\examples{
inc  <- c(1, 4, 6, 3)
time <- 0:3
time_to_peak(inc, time)

}
