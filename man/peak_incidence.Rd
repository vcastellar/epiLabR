\title{Peak incidence}
\usage{
peak_incidence(incidence, time = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{Numeric vector giving the incidence curve.}

\item{time}{Optional numeric vector of the same length giving time
points. If \code{NULL}, a regular time sequence is assumed.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{peak}{Maximum incidence value.}
\item{time}{Time at which the peak occurs.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the maximum value of an incidence curve and
the time at which it occurs.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{\lambda(t)} denote the incidence function.
The peak incidence is defined as:
\deqn{
\lambda_{\max} = \max_t \lambda(t),
}
and the corresponding time is:
\deqn{
t_{\max} = \arg\max_t \lambda(t).
}

If multiple time points attain the maximum value,
the first occurrence is returned.

If \code{time} is not provided, it is assumed to be a regular
sequence \code{1:length(incidence)}.

\examples{
inc  <- c(1, 3, 7, 5, 2)
time <- 0:4
peak_incidence(inc, time)
