\title{Initial doubling time}
\usage{
initial_doubling_time(incidence, time = NULL, n = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{Numeric vector of incidence values.}

\item{time}{Optional numeric vector of time points. Must have the
same length as \code{incidence}. If \code{NULL}, a regular time
sequence is assumed.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of initial time points used to estimate
the exponential growth rate. Default is 7.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the estimated initial doubling time.
}
\description{
Estimates the epidemic doubling time during the initial
exponential growth phase.
}
\details{
During the early phase of an epidemic, incidence is often
approximated by exponential growth:
\deqn{
\lambda(t) \approx \lambda_0 e^{r t}.
}

Under this assumption, the doubling time is:
\deqn{
T_d = \frac{\log 2}{r},
}
where \eqn{r} is the initial exponential growth rate,
estimated using \code{\link{initial_growth_rate}} over the
first \code{n} time points.

If \eqn{r \le 0}, the doubling time is set to \code{Inf}.

If \code{time} is not provided, it is assumed to be a regular
sequence \code{1:length(incidence)}.
