\title{Attack rate}
\usage{
attack_rate(incidence, time = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{Numeric vector giving the incidence curve.}

\item{time}{Optional numeric vector of time points. Must have the
same length as \code{incidence}, contain no missing values, and be
strictly increasing. If \code{NULL}, unit time steps are assumed.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the cumulative attack rate.
}
\description{
Computes the cumulative number of events from an incidence curve.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{\lambda(t)} denote the incidence function.
The attack rate is defined as:
\deqn{
AR = \int_0^T \lambda(t)\, dt.
}

In discrete time, this is approximated by:
\deqn{
AR \approx \sum_i \lambda(t_i)\,\Delta t_i,
}
where \eqn{\Delta t_i = t_{i+1} - t_i}.

If \code{time} is not provided, a regular time step of 1 is assumed,
and the attack rate reduces to the simple sum of the incidence values.

\examples{
inc <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
attack_rate(inc)
